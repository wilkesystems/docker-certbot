## Base Image for Certbot

The objective of Certbot, Let's Encrypt, and the ACME (Automated Certificate 
Management Environment) protocol is to make it possible to set up an HTTPS 
server and have it automatically obtain a browser-trusted certificate, without 
any human intervention. This is accomplished by running a certificate 
management agent on the web server.
